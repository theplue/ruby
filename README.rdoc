== README

This is my first ruby app. It is very basic, has students, profressors, courses and sections.
It is similar to a college, create a student, create a professor, and create a course. Assign a professor to a section of a course, and to come will be registering the student to the section.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version 4
* SQlite database


Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
